## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd credit-scoring-system
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. Place your raw data in the `data/raw/` directory
2. Run the data processing pipeline:
   ```bash
   python src/data/process_data.py
   ```

### Training the Model

```bash
python main.py --train
```

### Making Predictions

```bash
python predict.py --input data/processed/test_data.csv --output predictions.csv
```

## Testing

Run the test suite with:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
